## Execution Tips

For those who are teaching, here are some tips to help you execute the workshop:

1. **Hands-On Approach**: Include live coding sessions and encourage
   participants to code along.
2. **Focused Content**: Stick to the essentials and avoid deep dives into less
   critical topics.
3. **Resources**: Provide resources for further learning (documentation,
   tutorials, articles).
4. **Prepared Materials**: Have code snippets, slides, and resources ready to
   optimize time.
5. **Interactive Elements**: Use live coding or interactive examples to
   illustrate key points.
