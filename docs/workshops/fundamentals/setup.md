# Setting Up the Environment

- _Duration_: 5 minutes
- _Objective_: Ensure everyone has the necessary setup to follow along with
  workshop lessons and exercises.

To ensure a smooth and productive learning experience, it's essential to have
your development environment properly set up. This section will guide you
through the necessary steps and tools required to follow along with the React
Roblox workshop.

## Quick Setup Guide

The setup process involves a few key steps to get your environment ready for
React development within the Roblox framework. The steps are the same for all
workshops. So we'll take a brief detour to follow the [setup guide] before
continuing, but be sure to return.

## Familiarizing Yourself with the Development Environment

Before diving into the lessons, take some time to familiarize yourself with
Roblox Studio and Hoarcekat. Here are a few key points:

- Roblox Studio is the primary development environment for Roblox. It's where
  you'll build your games and experiences.
  - We'll need this synced with our code editor using Rojo to enable live
    coding.
  - In order to have access to React, we'll need to install our dependencies
    with Wally.
- Hoarcekat is a Roblox Studio plugin that enables you to view UI "stories",
  small, isolated sections of your UI, in real-time.
  - This is a great tool for quickly iterating on UI components and our lessons
    will use it extensively.

## Ready to Go!

With Roblox Studio set up and the react-roblox library installed, youâ€™re now
ready to start building with React in Roblox. Remember, setting up your
environment correctly is crucial for a hassle-free learning experience, so
ensure everything is working as expected before moving on to the next section.
