# Environment Setup

This lesson is less oriented at teaching you something new and more oriented at
making sure that your environment is setup correctly.

## Verify Setup

The `environment.lua` and `environment.story.lua` files can be used as a
diagnostic tool to verify that your environment is setup correctly.

1. Begin by opening the Hoarcekat plugin in Roblox Studio.
   - If the plugin is not showing up it is likely installed incorrectly. Try
     restarting Roblox Studio or asking your instructor for help.
2. Open the `environment.story.lua` file in the plugin. It may take some time to
   navigate to the file if you haven't used the plugin before.
   - If the file is not showing up you may not have opened or synced the correct
     project.
   - If the story errors when you open it, read the error message for
     diagnostic information. Many common errors are caught by this story with
     potential solutions.
