	We can also use state to control the behavior of our components. State is
	managed by the component itself and can be changed by the component. This is
	useful for things like toggling a button or showing a modal.

	We can use the `useState` hook to create state. The `useState` hook returns
	two values: the current state and a function to update the state. We pass in a
	default value to the `useState` hook.

	:::caution
	Keep in mind, the render function of a component should be a pure function.
	This means it can't cause any side effects. This means we can't call the
	`setText` function directly in the render function.

	Remember, that the reason the render function needs to be a pure function is
	because React uses it's pureness to determine if a component needs to be
	re-rendered. If we call `setText` directly in the render function, React will
	see that the render function is not pure and will re-render the component
	every time we update the state. This will cause an infinite loop.
