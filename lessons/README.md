# Lessons

This directory contains the lessons for all workshops. Each lesson is a
directory that contains a `README.md` file that explains the materials for that
individual lesson.

## Lesson Structure

Each lesson directory typically contains the following structure:

- `README.md`: The lesson's materials and instructions.
- `exercises/`: A directory containing exercises for the lesson.
- `solution/`: Solution files for the corresponding exercises. These contain
  potential solutions to exercises that can be used to verify that the lesson's
  exercises are completed correctly.
- `assets/`: A directory containing assets for the lesson or exercise if
  necessary.
- `*.spec.lua`: Test files for the lesson. These can be used to verify that the
  lesson's exercises are completed correctly.
- `*.story.lua`: Story files for the lesson. These can be used to view the
  lesson's visuals in Roblox Studio.
